## Overview

### The challenge

Main learning points of following this tutorial:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus from myself**:
  - Add accessible links
  - Use Sass preprocessor
  - Use pseudo-selectors
  - Use em and rem instead of px

## My process

I started out with reviewing the concept at the beginning of tutorial. Next, I opened the [project provided by Kevin](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/75d448ea-569a-4b7e-721b-9bbd3b2b97b9-03e5/grid) and coded the whole page with scss by myself. Lastly, I reviewed the second part of tutorial to notice and correct any mistakes in my project, e.g. missing aside element, messy paddings and margins.
As last touch-up, I checked the accessibility of the website with tabs, added few links and a skip-link at the top of page.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS syntax with variables and mixins
- BEM

### What I learned

- Picture manipulation with aspect-ratio property

- Usage of pseudo-selectors in SCSS 
  ([Helpful resource](https://css-tricks.com/the-sass-ampersand/))

  ```css
  .article-sidebar {
    &:not(:last-child) h3 {
      margin-block-end: 1em;
    }
  }
  ```

- Good practices of writing code

Kevin Powell pointed out that specifying element's bottom margin is usually better than mixing it with top margins and paddings. This practice is especially useful when the website is populated with more content the problem with reorderring elements and readjusting margins doesn't appear.
