			<h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
			<p><span>I used to be a pack rat</span>. I had so many things that I thought that I
				loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
			<p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't
				hold a
				relationship.</p>
			<h3>How I turned things around</h3>
			<p><span>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</span>. I literally put 90% of my
				possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
			<p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do.
				And
				it worked.</p>
			<h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
			<p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work
				more,
				and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
			<p>With how much it turned my life around, <span>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I
					did
					it</span>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this
				site!
