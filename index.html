        are many ways
        to simplify your life, <a href="#">a few of which we've explored in the past</a>. This week we're taking

          <p class="article__paragraph">Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be
            healthy,
            you
            have
            to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

          <h2>Simplicity and work</h2>
          <p class="article__paragraph">Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins
            their
            relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it
            will
            help balance everything out.

          <h2>Simple decorations</h2>
          <p class="article__paragraph">A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't
            decorate,
            or
            they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the
            eye
            where you want it to and make things pop like never before.</p>
